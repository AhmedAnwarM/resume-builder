The project consisted of 2 main large modules: Company Establishment and Company Modifications\nBoth modules were built using IBM Case Manager for workflow and content management, and were deployed on WebSphere Application Server. The front-end was built using dojo JavaScript framework. DevOps for both projects included an impressive CI/CD pipeline using GitLab webhooks, Jenkins jobs, SonarQube code scanner, Artifactory, and Rundeck to execute remote commands on the target environment.\nThe company establishment module was built using a monolithic approach, while the company modifications module was enhanced in regards to architecture design and used a more service-based or modular approach where each module was split into a separate application. Some other common modules were then refactored using a micro-services approach, some of them using fat-jar servers like WildFly Swarm (aka Thorntail)\nThis project also involved integration with another software vendor designing a portal for the public to use.\nAfter a few months in the project, my responsibilities were shifted more towards team leading, client communication and integration with the other vendor company as well as implementing and sizing new common modules and change requests."},{title:"Insurance Claims Management (Unicare)",description:"A claims management and approvals system for a health insurance provider that uses IBM Case Manager to manage the workflows necessary for managing claims and approval requests.\nThe project also included a web portal for administering the system and submitting new requests."},{title:"Meetings Management System (YESSER)",description:"A meetings management system for a Saudi government entity, which included a web portal as well as iOS and Android applications."},{title:"Loan Appraisal (Mortgage Finance Fund)",description:"This was a project for a government entity in Egypt.

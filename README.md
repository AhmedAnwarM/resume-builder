This is a simple web app made using React. It reads the Resume data from a JSON file in
the `src/data/cv-data.js` directory and populated the interface from that data.

This will open your Resume. At the top of the page, you will find the "Download PDF" button which
will download your resume in PDF format with all the links working.
